        Answer:\n
        1. Initialize an empty set to store characters we've seen.
        2. Iterate through each character in the string.
        If the character is in our set, it's a repeat, and we return it.
        If it's not in the set, add it to the set and continue.
        3. If we finish the loop without finding a repeat, it means there are no repeated characters, so we can return an appropriate value like `None`.\n
